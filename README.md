# PyBer_Analysis
analyzing data from ride share app to uncover trends in the large dataset 
# Overview of Analysis
Using Pandas and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebooks, conducted ride-sharing analysis by the city type (either Urban, Suburban, or Rural). The analysis of how the data differs by the type of city will be important for the executives at PyBer for future decisions. The analysis included the total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver by city type. 
## Results
The results of my analysis saw how the data differed by city type. For rural areas, there were 125 PyBer rides with 78 total drivers. Althought the total fare for rural areas was $4,327.93, they had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver when comparing with urban and suburban areas. For suburban areas, there were 625 PyBer rides with 490 total drivers. The total fares was $19,356.33 with an average fare per ride of $30.97 and an average fare per driver of $39.50. Lastly, for urban areas, there was a major increase in total rides and total drivers with 1,625 and 2,405 respectively. Even though the total fare was nearly $40,000, the average fare per ride was $24.53 and average fare per driver was $16.57. The summary of the data by city type will be below.

The next part of the analysis was looking at the data by city type for a 4 month period from January 2019 to April 2019. Putting the total fare data in weekly bins allowed us to look at how each city type performed per week during this 4 month period. Each week, urban PyBer drivers dominated the total fare while rural areas total fare was nowhere near those of the urban areas. The line chart of the weekly, 4 month analysis will be below.

## Summary
These results are important as it can help PyBer be more successful in urban, suburban, and rural areas for years to come. To address the disparities among the type of city, I think some drivers who drive in urban cities should shift their focus to suburban and rural areas. The rural area drivers have the highest average fare per ride and per driver so there is more money to be made outside the city. One way to do this is offer incentives to make drivers shift to rural areas. Another business idea to help increase average fare per ride and driver per city is include a bonus for when it is extra busy for PyBer users. This can allow urban drivers to make more money on average. Lastly, I recommend possibly making urban drivers provide a more upscale experience on PyBer. This could allow higher fares, but at the same time increasing the quality of the rides.
